The Sized Trait
What is Sized?:
The Sized trait is a special trait in Rust that indicates whether a type's size is known at compile time. Most types are Sized, meaning Rust knows their size in advance.

Default Generic Functions:
By default, generic functions in Rust assume that their type parameters are Sized. This means they only work with types whose sizes are known at compile time.
A
llowing Unsized Types:

To work with types that may or may not be Sized, you use ?Sized. For example:
rust
Copy code
fn generic<T: ?Sized>(t: &T) {
    // --snip--
}
This function can handle types that are not Sized by taking a reference to them (&T).
